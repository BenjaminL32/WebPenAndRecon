# Assignment on Software Defined Radios

## A) Testing WebSDR  
To test WebSDR I first navigated to my borwser and typed in "websdr.com" and started browsing different WebSDR´s  
For this i chose Northern Utah as the location.

</br>  
After navigating to it I am taken to a landing page, where i can choose different recievers. I chose WebSDR1, because i think it will be easier to find a AM-broadcast i can listen.

</br>
Now that I am on the website, I will try to find a broadcast.  
FiRst a changed the wavelength to AM-160M-120M.

</br>  
After that I started looking at the waterfall to find a frequency that has traffic.

</br>
As we can see, there is quite a few frequencies from which to choose from so I picked one that had a strong signal strength, in this case it was 1430kHz.  
And after tuning on to it and changing the modulation to amplitude modulation, beautiful spanish music started playing from my speakers.  
After listening for I while, adverts startred playing.

## Downloading rtl_443  
I will be downloading this to a virtual machine, so i started a fresh machine on VirtualBox running Debian.  
After a new machine was up, i opened the terminal and gave the following commands:  
1. `wget https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/releases/download/25.02/rtl_433-soapysdr-openssl3-Linux-amd64-25.02.zip`  
2. `aunpack rtl*.zip`  
    (Commands from: https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)
   


After giving these commands, i tried to see if it would run.  
I gave the command `./rtl_433` i was given this output  
<img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b9c7650-5fdc-4457-b0e7-ad0757400fbf" />
</br>
From this output I am going to assume the program is running.  
</br>

## C) Analyzing a given sample  
I downloaded the samplefile from the teacher´s website (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)  
After the sample file was downloaded, i gave the following command to open it in rtl_433.  
`./rtl_433 -r Converted_433.92M_2000k.cs8` ( Sample-file name: Converted_433.92M_2000k.cs8)  
The follwing output was produced (not all output fit on screen).  
<img width="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c63577ed-6241-4c6a-b29e-a6f552aeb337" />  
</br>
From this sample I can see that there is some sort of signals coming from three different machines, Nexa-Security, Proove-Secrurity and KlikAanKlikUit-Switch.  
The captured signals contain the following information fields.  
1. Time  
2. Model  
3. Channel  
4. Group  
5. State  
6. Housecode  
7. ID  
8. Unit
With my current understanding I am not able to analyze deeper.
