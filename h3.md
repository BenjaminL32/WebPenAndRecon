# Assignment on Software Defined Radios  
</br>

## A) Testing WebSDR  
To test WebSDR I first navigated to my borwser and typed in "websdr.com" and started browsing different WebSDR´s  
For this i chose Northern Utah as the location.  
<img width="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/500a4954-1ccb-4cd6-8de8-bae011b94c77" />  
</br>  
After navigating to it I am taken to a landing page, where i can choose different recievers. I chose WebSDR1, because i think it will be easier to find a AM-broadcast i can listen.  
<img width="761" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5989a73f-ff2b-42ce-b526-1c1ee8eb41b4" />  
</br>
Now that I am on the website, I will try to find a broadcast.  
FiRst a changed the wavelength to AM-160M-120M.  
<img width="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bceb7517-6a4c-4ee4-834e-76da321c2097" />  
</br>  
After that I started looking at the waterfall to find a frequency that has traffic.

</br>
As we can see, there is quite a few frequencies from which to choose from so I picked one that had a strong signal strength, in this case it was 1430kHz.  
And after tuning on to it and changing the modulation to amplitude modulation, beautiful spanish music started playing from my speakers.  
After listening for I while, adverts startred playing.

## Downloading rtl_443  
I will be downloading this to a virtual machine, so i started a fresh machine on VirtualBox running Debian.  
After a new machine was up, i opened the terminal and gave the following commands:  
1. `wget https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/releases/download/25.02/rtl_433-soapysdr-openssl3-Linux-amd64-25.02.zip`  
2. `aunpack rtl*.zip`  
    (Commands from: https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)
   


After giving these commands, i tried to see if it would run.  
I gave the command `./rtl_433` i was given this output  
<img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b9c7650-5fdc-4457-b0e7-ad0757400fbf" />
</br>
From this output I am going to assume the program is running.  
</br>

## C) Analyzing a given sample  
I downloaded the samplefile from the teacher´s website (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)  
After the sample file was downloaded, i gave the following command to open it in rtl_433.  
`./rtl_433 -r Converted_433.92M_2000k.cs8` ( Sample-file name: Converted_433.92M_2000k.cs8)  
The follwing output was produced (not all output fit on screen).  
<img width="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c63577ed-6241-4c6a-b29e-a6f552aeb337" />  
</br>
From this sample I can see that there is some sort of signals coming from three different machines, Nexa-Security, Proove-Secrurity and KlikAanKlikUit-Switch.  
The captured signals contain the following information fields.  
1. Time  
2. Model  
3. Channel  
4. Group  
5. State  
6. Housecode  
7. ID  
8. Unit
With my current understanding I am not able to analyze deeper.
</br>
## D) Trying to convert .complex16s format to .cs8
</br>
After numerous tries, i was unable to get the file " Recorded-HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz.complex16s" opened with RTL_443.  
I tried to change the name of the files countless times and always got the same error message in the end.  
<img width="377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8343a2a8-ec7f-4684-b06a-3d33f4c26d17" />  
</br>
After an hour of troubleshooting I am giving up :(
</br>
</br>
## E) Installing URH (Ultimate Radio Hacker)  
I will start installation by following the teacher's instructions  
<img width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc46341-cc9e-4d54-a396-38f24682f194" />  
(Karvinen. T, Verkkoon tunkeutuminen ja tiedustelu, 2025)  
</br>
</br>
And after giving the commands in the exact order presented above, URH opened succesfully.  
<img width="636" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6b0bd98-7b71-4a7f-8436-492da592a4db" />  
</br>

## F) Analyzing given sample with URH  
After opening URH, i navigated to the "file" tab, and opened the given file given on teacher's website: "https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/"  
<img width="629" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b579a1ad-fc87-47d9-8e69-a8e0017e4903" />  
</br>
Now that the file is open, I will start analyzing it and getting familiar with everything the software can tell me.  
<img width="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb81cfa-6c08-423c-8d91-5ab337136405" />  
</br>
By selecting the entire capture from this window, i can see that the capture length is 5,49 seconds long and the signal strengt was -15,2dBm, which would suggest this was recorded quite close to the reciever (signal strength range is -100dbm-0dbm)  

## E Analyzing deeper

I am able to see from the raw data that the length of one raw bit is 0,5ms  
<img width="130" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1f1d772-db85-4bb2-8773-248f483450dd" />
</br>

The spectrogram view would seem to suggest that this is frequence modulated signal, but I am not entirely sure about that.
