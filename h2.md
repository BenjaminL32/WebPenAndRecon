# Port scanning and detection
In this assignment I will be trying to set up a local webserver, scanning its ports and trying to find evidence of port scanning from logfiles.  
## First step - Downloading apache2 and starting it.  
I already have VirtualBox installed on my computer and a machine up running Debian.  
So the next step is opening the terminal and installing apache2 with the command `sudo apt-get install apache2` and as we can see, installation started.  
<img width="329" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32a245c1-a0c2-415d-aae3-25d10ad403ee" />  
</br>
After this I gave the command `sudo systemctl start apache2` to get the apache2 service started.  
<img width="260" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd4003a-85a3-44dd-85d4-88da25fc9e17" />  
</br>
Now that the service is running, I tested that it was by navigating to my browser and typing "http://localhost/" to the searchbar.  
The result was that my service was indeed up.  
<img width="419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/191f8b1f-5412-4c48-a6ed-6ffdebe0e05e" />  
</br>
After getting the web server up and running, it was time to see if there were signs that I had visited on the site in the apache2 logfiles.  
This is done with the command from the teacher´s instructions (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)  
`sudo tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log`  
After giving this command, I was greeted with a text file containing all the request the website had got until now.  
<img width="367" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf58c7e-3372-4955-955f-65f2df196e37" />  
</br>
From this logfile I can deduce that these http GET requests were made from mozilla firefox browser and they were coming from the ip address "128.0.0.1 (local).  
They also show the time they were made and the host they were trying to reach (http://localhost).  
## Testing port scanning  
For the port scanning test, I disabled my internet connection to my virtual machine as a precaution as port scanning any other device than my on is illegal.  
I did this by navigating to my VirtualBox settings and unchecking "cable connected" box from the network settings.  
<img width="419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8fd29ce-454e-4cb4-b673-438f8fd569ed" />
</br>
Now that that the internet connection has been severed, I will try the port scan. I opened the terminal and gave the command found in the teacher´s instructions: `sudo nmap -A localhost`   (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)
After giving this command, I got a message that nmap could not be found.  
<img width="164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7be80e4-9f2f-40f1-8146-e60d7347da8f" />  
So  I have to reconnect my virtual machine to the internet, and download nmap with the command `sudo apt-get install nmap`.
</br>
Now that it is installed, I will try the port scan again. This time it was succesful.  
<img width="359" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52c989f4-bded-4214-bada-09a020784839" />  
</br>
From this scan I can see that there are 3 ports open, 25/tcp, 80/tcp and 631/tcp. The scan finds that behind port 80 is the apache2 webserver.  
</br>
## Scripts behind ports scans
</br>

<img width="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c6d3f3e-5a11-43fa-aa6d-a7d69f4400c8" />  
From this screen capture, I can see that scripts that were automatically on when using "-A" parameter in the command `sudo nmap -A localhost` were http-title, http-server-header and http-robots.txt.  
</br>
## Checking the logs for evidence of port scanning  
<img width="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90174ebe-9aa6-46bc-8501-7b37e1e3cab3" />  
I navigated to my apache2 webserver logs with the command `sudo tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log` and found quite a few rows containing lines that say "nmap scripting engine" but im not quite sure this is actually evidence of port scanning.  
</br>
## Detectiing port scan using wireshark  
I have wireshark installed from previous assignments, but that would be done on linux with the command `sudo apt-get install wireshark`
I opened wireshark, and will choose loopback to be the interface that the traffic is captured from.  
<img width="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7635cdd7-6d44-4bca-a272-ae6e47ccf303" />
</br>
Now that I chose the loopback interface and started the packet capture, I will now run the port scan again with the command `sudo nmap -a localhost`  
After running the port scan, wireshark captured 3005 packets. To find evidence of port scanning, pressed CTRL-F to open the finding function.  I typed "nmap" to the finder, and i found packet 2378 containing a get request running a nmap script.  
<img width="370" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab54495a-163c-4974-9e92-a87b2ec9339a" />  
</br>
I also found a response for the GET request on packet 2390. The response contained information that apache2 web server was running behind the port.  
<img width="366" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e009cb99-2b35-4f3f-b17c-03368be3d928" />  
</br>
## Capturing traffic with "ngrep" command  
I could use the `ngrep` command to capture and show all traffic, but in this instance we only want to show packets containing the word "nmap" to once again find evidence on port scanning.  
This is done with the command `sudo ngrep -d lo -i nmap` found in teacher´s instructions (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)  
Now that the capture is started, I will once again run the port scan.  
<img width="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2daa7ebd-144a-491a-ba60-cf54b7a76a6c" />  
After running the port scan i got multiple packets once again containing the word "nmap". In the picture above is a packet coming into port 80.  
</br>
## Switching nmap user-agent and analyzing traffic  
Now I will try to switch the user agent of nmap, so that it looks like a normal web-browser and looking in to the logfiles/captured traffic to see if there is a change.  
I will run the port scan as normally, but i will add a script to it so that the port scan is coming from a different address. The full command given is `sudo nmap -A localhost --script-args http.useragent="BSD experimental on XBox360 alpha (emulated on Nokia 3310)"` ( script from teacher´s materials: https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)  
After I started network capture with the command `sudo ngrep -d lo -i nmap` and running the port scan, the following packet was captured:  
<img width="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee86a4a-994c-4cd3-9cf0-2bc46f73c3d4" />  
</br>
As we can see, the traffic seems to be coming from a BSD experimental browser running on an emulated xbox360 :) 
As we can see in the following picture, the apache logfiles reflects that as well  
<img width="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4c58d1a-526e-4b4b-89b4-1919d2afea05" />  
</br>
I tried this once again while wireshark capture was running and i could not find the "word" nmap in any of the captured packets.  
<img width="407" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45a853ff-ad9f-4ea5-8f49-a96e2c786456" />  
</br>
## Removing "nmap" from the scripts  
After an hour of combing over nmap-files and lua-scripts, I unfortunately did not figure out where i could remove the "nmap" text from the scripts :(

### Pyramid of pain
The pyramid of pain illustrates how much pain it causes an attacker that you have detected them. Each level of the pyramid represents different thing you can learn from an attacker and the higer you go on the pyramid, the more difficult the information is to gather. 
</br>
### Diamond Model  
The diamond model is used in cybersecurity to analyze attacks. It tries to answer 4 questions.  
1. What infrastructure is being used in the attack?  
2. Who is the victim?  
3. Who is the attacker?  
4. How did they do it?
