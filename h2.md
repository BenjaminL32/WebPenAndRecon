# Port scanning and detection
In this assignement, I will be trying to set up a local webserver, scanning its ports, and trying to find evidence of port scanning from logfiles.  
## First step - Downloading apache2 and starting it.  
I already have VirtualBox installed on my computer, and a machine up running Debian.  
So the next step is opening the terminal and installing apache2 with the command `sudo apt-get install apache2` and as we can see, installation started.

</br>
After this I gave the command `sudo systemctl start apache2` to get the apache2 service started.

Now that the service is running, I tested that it was by navigating to my browser and typing "http://localhost/" to the searchbar.  
The result was that my service was indeed up.

After getting the web server up and running, it was time to see if there were signs that I had visited on the site in the apache2 logfiles.  
This is done with the command from the teachers instructions (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/) `sudo tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log`  
After giving this command, I was greeted with a text file containing all the request the website had got until now.

</br>
From this logfile i can deduce that these http GET reguest were made from mozilla firefox browser and they were coming from the ip address "128.0.0.1 (local).  
They also show the time they were made and the host they were trying to reach (http://localhost).
