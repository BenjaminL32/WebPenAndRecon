# Port scanning and detection
In this assignment I will be trying to set up a local webserver, scanning its ports and trying to find evidence of port scanning from logfiles.  
## First step - Downloading apache2 and starting it.  
I already have VirtualBox installed on my computer and a machine up running Debian.  
So the next step is opening the terminal and installing apache2 with the command `sudo apt-get install apache2` and as we can see, installation started.

</br>
After this I gave the command `sudo systemctl start apache2` to get the apache2 service started.

</br>
Now that the service is running, I tested that it was by navigating to my browser and typing "http://localhost/" to the searchbar.  
The result was that my service was indeed up.

</br>
After getting the web server up and running, it was time to see if there were signs that I had visited on the site in the apache2 logfiles.  
This is done with the command from the teacher´s instructions (https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/)  
`sudo tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log`  
After giving this command, I was greeted with a text file containing all the request the website had got until now.

</br>
From this logfile I can deduce that these http GET requests were made from mozilla firefox browser and they were coming from the ip address "128.0.0.1 (local).  
They also show the time they were made and the host they were trying to reach (http://localhost).  
## Testing port scanning  
For the port scanning test, I disabled my internet connection to my virtual machine as a precaution as port scanning any other device than my on is illegal.  
I did this by navigating to my VirtualBox settings and unchecking "cable connected" box from the network settings.

</br>
Now that that the internet connection has been severed, I will try the port scan. I opened the terminal and gave the command found in the teacher´s instructions: `sudo nmap -A localhost`  
After giving this command, I got a message that nmap could not be found.  
<img width="164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7be80e4-9f2f-40f1-8146-e60d7347da8f" />  
So  I have to reconnect my virtual machine to the internet, and download nmap with the command `sudo apt-get install nmap`.
</br>
Now that it is installed, I will try the port scan again. This time it was succesful.

</br>
From this scan I can see that there are 3 ports open, 25/tcp, 80/tcp and 631/tcp. The scan finds that behind port 80 is the apache2 webserver.  
</br>
## Scripts behind ports

From this screen capture, I can see that scripts that were automatically on when using "-A" parameter in the command `sudo nmap -A localhost`
