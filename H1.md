# Network sniffing assignement.

## A
Linux Debian up and running in VirtualBox, no problems with installisation.

## B
I tested that i can remove the internet connection from my virtual machine, by navigating to network settings in VirtualBox, and virtually removing the network cable by clicking "Cable Connected" to off-state. (See picture below)

## C
I installed wireshark to my virtal machine with the command " Sudo apt-get install wireshark", and got it up and running, but i had issues with getting it to work.

This error message popped up. I tried to run commands shown on the screenshot but this did not fix it. I finally fixed it by running it as an administrator with the command "sudo wireshark".
Once i finally got it running, i was able to capture traffic.

In the screenshot above is shown all the headers contained in an HTTP get request. This packet contains all layers in the TCP/IP stack, explained below.  
1. First off the top is the link-layer routing information.
2. The second off the top is also link-layer routing information, or data-link layer data in OSI-model. This layer does routing with MAC-addresses.
3. Third off the top is internet/Network layer routing information. This layer does routing with IP-addresses.
4. And the last one contains application layer data, in this case the it contains the HTTP GET request

## E
After opening "Surfing-secure.pcap" file and glossing over the data, it seems that this data has been gathered form normal website usage, navigating to different websites.  
Protcols shown in the captured traffic list include TCP, IP, UDP,  

## F
I was unable to find browser used in this list.

## G
It seems that the interface card being used in the captured traffic list "Surfing-secure.pcap" is Realtek  

## H  
i Found three different web servers visited: terokarvinen.com, goatcounter.netlify.com and terokarvinen.goatcounter.com

## I

In the picture above, i have captured three different packets.  
The first packet is an ARP request, asking  the target IP to return its MAC address.  
The second packet is an response to the first ARP requuest, returning its MAC address to the asker.  
The third packet is an TCP packet, and it contains an error message, that would suggest that a packet before it was lost.  

## Summary of references
Wireshark-Getting started:
- Wireshark installation on linux debian is done with the command "sudo apt-get install wireshark".  
- You can manually select a network interface to sniff in wireshark.

Natework Interface Names:
-Interface prefix tells you the onnection type, en for wired ethernet, wl for WLAN an lo for lookup adresses.
- You can check your network interfaces with the command "ip a"
